Getting git
===========

If you don't already have `git`,
you can download it at [the official git website](https://git-scm.com/),
or follow the directions below for your operating system.

Mac OS X
--------
If you have a Mac with OS X,
you will most likely already have git.
If not, an easy to install way would be using Homebrew,
a package manager for Mac OS X.

Linux
-----
Depending on your distro, you will likely already have `git.
If not, you can download it using the package manager used by your distro.
E.g. for Ubuntu or Debian use `apt-get install git`, or for CentOS / Red-hat
use `yum install git` or `rpm install git`.

Windows
-------
I'm not that familiar with modern windows setups.
I would probably just get it from [the official git website](https://git-scm.com/).
