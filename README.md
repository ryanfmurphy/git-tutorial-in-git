Welcome to my Git Tutorial within git!
======================================

Hello and welcome.

This tutorial is to help people
get more acquainted with the versioning tool known as `git`.

There are lots of git tutorials out there,
but what makes this one different is that
the whole tutorial is a git repository
that you learn about git by navigating through.

This file, `README.md`, is a file in the repository.
We'll begin here.

First, Make sure you have `git` on your computer.  Go to
[getting git](/Getting git.md) if you need help.


Cloning the Repository
----------------------

Once you have `git` installed,
the first thing you'll want to do
is get a copy of the responitory onto your computer
so you can explore it and go through the tutorial.
This is called cloning the respository,
and it is done with the `git clone` command.

To clone the repository,
go to your Command Line and type this at your keyboard:

    git clone https://www.github.com/ryanfmurphy/git_tutorial_in_git
